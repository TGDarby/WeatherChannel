### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. API keys can be used to track and control how an API is used.
2. An API-centric web application executes most, if not all, of its functions through calling an API. 
3. APIs can have a variety of query parameters that are sent as an HTTP Request to the API server.
4. API methods are used to retrieve various types of data from the API server.
5. Each HTML element in the DOM has an id associated with a "key" in the key/value pair from the data retrieved from the API server.
